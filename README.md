# LITA_HR_Dataset
Documentation of my LITA HR dataset from Nigerian states over the years to draw insights about attrition trends.



### Project Overview
---

This project focuses on analyzing population data from Nigerian states over the years to draw insights about attrition trends. By leveraging Excel and Power BI, we aim to create a comprehensive analysis and visualization that highlights key trends and patterns in population changes.

### Objectives
---

The objectives of this analysis were:

1. Analyze Population Growth: Compare population data from 2006 and 2019 to identify growth patterns.

2. Examine Regional Differences: Investigate how population changes vary across different states.

3. Visualize Data: Develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to present the findings in an engaging and insightful manner.

### Data Sources
---

The data source is the HR dataset containing population information for various Nigerian states, attrition, including longitude, latitude, population figures for 2006, and population figures for 2019.

### Tools Used
---
The tools used were:

- Excel: For data cleaning, initial exploration, and basic analysis.

- Power BI: For creating interactive and visually appealing dashboards to present the insights.

### Methodology
---
1. Data Cleaning:

- Imported the dataset into Excel.
- Ensured data accuracy and consistency by cleaning and formatting the data.
- Handled missing values and outliers appropriately.

2. Data Analysis:

- Analyzed the population data using Excel formulas to compute growth rates and other relevant metrics.
- Examined regional differences in population changes to understand varying trends.
- Dashboard Visualization:

3. I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to present the analysis.

- Created visualizations to highlight population growth trends, regional differences, and other key insights. 
- Included maps, and bar charts for a comprehensive view of the data.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
In the exploratory phase, we utilized Excel to create pivot tables and summarize population data. This helped in identifying states with the highest and lowest population growth. Calculating growth rates provided a clear picture of population trends over the years like attrition rate, attrition count, average age of total employee, current employee by their marital status and so on.

### Data Analysis
---

By analyzing the data, i uncovered significant insights such as:

- Top Growth States: I Identified states with the highest population growth between 2006 and 2019.
- Regional Trends: Noted regional differences in population growth, with some states experiencing more rapid increases than others.
- Attrition Trends: Examined states with population decline or slower growth to understand potential attrition factors.

### Dashboard Visualization
---
The Power BI dashboard brought these insights to life with interactive elements:
- Population Growth Trends: Visualized using line graphs to show changes over time.
- Regional Differences: Illustrated through maps and bar charts to highlight how different states compare.
- Detailed Insights: Provided drill-down capabilities to explore specific states and their population changes in detail.
